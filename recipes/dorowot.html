       <p >Doro Wot (also spelled Doro Wat) is a famous Ethiopian
         chicken stew, often considered the national dish of Ethiopia.
          It is known for its deep, rich flavor, spicy aroma, and dark 
          red color, typically served with <a href="injera.html">Injera</a> (a spongy sourdough 
          flatbread). The dish is traditionally enjoyed during holidays,
           special occasions, and gatherings. </p>
